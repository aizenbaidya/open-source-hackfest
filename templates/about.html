        Test your skills with our interactive flashcard game! Start with easy
        problems and work your way up to more challenging ones. Can you conquer all the
        levels?

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Each flashcard will present a problem from the chosen dataset. Solve
            enough correctly to move on to the next one. As you progress, the
            difficulty increases!
        </p>
        <p>Once you conquered a level you can move onto the next stage</p>
        <p>Once you solve one problem you will be able to move onto the next one</p>
        <p>There will be 3 levels of difficulty you will need to pass through in order to complete a topic</p>

        <p>This project was created for the <a href="https://events.mlh.io/events/11515-open-source-hackfest"

            The dataset can be of any topic so it doesn't need to just be programming
            related topics

            Select from one of our pre-made datasets or choose one created by your
            peers
        </p>
        <p>Help teach others to code by uploading your own dataset of problems</p>

        <h2> Next Steps </h2>
        <p>For security reasons we made it so that you will have to use your own databases our next step will be to find a way to properly secure the main database so that we can open it up to the public and allow you to share databases with others to make it truly opensourse</p>
        <p>We want to add more games you can play with the data set</p>
        <p>We want to add achievents and statistics so you can compare them and compete with your friends</p>

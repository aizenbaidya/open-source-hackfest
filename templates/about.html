    <h1>Welcome to Recall Royale!</h1>
    <p>
        Test your skills with our interactive flashcard game! Start with easy
        problems and work your way up to more challenging ones. Can you conquer all the
        levels?
    </p>

            Each flashcard will present a problem from the chosen dataset. Solve
            enough correctly to move on to the next one. As you progress, the
            difficulty increases!
        </p>
        <p>Once you conquered a level you can move onto the next stage</p>
        <p>
            There will be 3 levels you will need to pass through in order to complete
            a topic
